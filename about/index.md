I’m Roger Stringer, and I’m a web and mobile software developer in Penticton, British Columbia, Canada. I wrote the Twilio Cookbook.

I work heavily with [Twilio][1], PHP, third-party APIs (developing and consuming) and WordPress.

I am the founder and sole developer of [FlyBase][2], which is powered by Twilio and enables people to schedule and record interviews.

I also blog heavily at my personal blog, [RogerStringer.com][3]
